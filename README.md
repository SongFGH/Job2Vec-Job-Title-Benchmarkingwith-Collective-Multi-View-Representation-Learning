# Job2Vec: Job Title Benchmarking with Collective Multi-View Representation Learning

This repository contains code for our ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) paper: [Job Title Benchmarking with Collective Multi-View Representation Learning](https://github.com/zdh2292390/Job2Vec-Job-Title-Benchmarkingwith-Collective-Multi-View-Representation-Learning/blob/master/presentation/CIKM19_job2vec.pdf) (Job2Vec). Job Title Benchmarking (JTB) aims at matching job titles with similar expertise levels across various companies. We aggregate all the records to construct a large-scale Job Title Benchmarking Graph (Job-Graph), where nodes denote job titles affiliated with specific companies and links denote the correlations between jobs.


## Running the code
The code is MATLAB code works in Ubuntu system.
